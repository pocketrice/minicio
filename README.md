_VPhysics/Euphoria/DMM-inspired physics for playful realism!_ The plan is to sacrifice some potential accuracy for more interesting and broader interactions whilst retaining a low performance footprint. 

This is a subcomponent of the [allory](https://github.com/pocketrice/allory) project but will initially be prototyped separately with the intent of either ❶ branching into an independent endeavor if allory cannot achieve extensibility or ❷ become a core component of the allory package.
